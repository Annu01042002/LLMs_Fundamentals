# 🚀 LLMs Fundamentals — A Daily Hands-On Exploration

Welcome to **LLMs_Fundamentals**, a clean, structured, and experiment-driven repository created for anyone who wants to deeply understand how Large Language Models actually work — from core fundamentals to practical applications.

This space is designed to **explore LLMs together**, one concept and one experiment at a time, without overwhelming theory or long lectures.  
Each folder represents a focused daily module with clear notes, guided practice, and small tasks that help build strong intuition.

## 🎯 What This Repository Covers (High-Level)

This repository captures all the core building blocks required to understand modern LLMs and build practical GenAI applications — without revealing specific day-wise content.  
At a high level, it includes:

### 🔹 Core LLM Fundamentals
- What powers modern LLMs  
- Transformers & attention mechanisms  
- Model behavior, reasoning patterns, and limitations  
- Tokenization & embeddings  
- Context windows and inference dynamics  

### 🔹 Prompting & Interaction Design
- How to design effective prompts  
- Structuring instructions  
- Controlling output behavior  
- Reducing ambiguity  
- Techniques that improve consistency  

### 🔹 Retrieval & Knowledge-Augmented LLMs
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) intuition  
- Document chunking  
- Vector search basics  
- How LLMs use external knowledge  

### 🔹 Tools, Functions & Real-World Usage
- Function calling  
- Tool-augmented reasoning  
- JSON schema design  
- Building small utility agents  

### 🔹 Agentic Thinking Concepts
- Stepwise reasoning  
- Action–observation loops  
- Memory handling  
- Lightweight agent behavior  

### 🔹 Mini Projects & Practical Exercises
Throughout the repo, you will find several small, impactful projects such as:
- Simple analysis tools  
- RAG pipelines  
- Lightweight agent demos  
- Prompt-based utilities  

These are intentionally small so learners can build confidence quickly.
