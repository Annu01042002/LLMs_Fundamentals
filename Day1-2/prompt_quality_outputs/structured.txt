1.  A solar panel is a device that converts sunlight directly into electricity.
2.  They are made of semiconductor materials, most commonly silicon, arranged in layers within photovoltaic cells. When sunlight (photons) hits these cells, it knocks electrons loose from their atoms.
3.  The cell's design creates an electric field that pushes these free electrons in one direction, forming a direct current (DC). Connecting multiple cells together amplifies this flow of electrons, generating usable power.
4.  An inverter then converts this DC electricity into alternating current (AC) suitable for household use and sends it to the home's electrical panel.
5.  This clean energy can power lights, appliances, and even charge electric vehicles.
