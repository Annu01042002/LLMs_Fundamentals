Solar panels work by capturing sunlight and turning it into usable electricity. When sunlight hits the panels, it energizes special materials inside called photovoltaic cells. These cells, typically made of silicon, absorb the light particles (photons), which knocks electrons loose from their atoms. This movement of electrons creates an electric current, producing direct current (DC) electricity. This DC electricity then flows to an inverter, which converts it into alternating current (AC) electricity, suitable for household use. From there, the AC electricity powers your home's lights and appliances, or it can be stored in batteries or sent back to the main electrical grid.
