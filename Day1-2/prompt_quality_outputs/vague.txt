Solar panels, also known as **photovoltaic (PV) panels**, work by converting sunlight directly into electricity using a process called the **photovoltaic effect**.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1.  **The Core Component: The Solar Cell**
    *   A solar panel is made up of many individual solar cells, typically made from **silicon**, a semiconductor material.
    *   Each silicon cell is specially treated to create an electric field, much like a battery. This is done by creating two different layers:
        *   **N-type layer (Negative):** Silicon is "doped" (infused) with impurities (like phosphorus) that add extra **electrons**, giving it a net negative charge.
        *   **P-type layer (Positive):** Silicon is doped with impurities (like boron) that create "holes" (places where electrons are missing), giving it a net positive charge.
    *   When these two layers are placed together, they form a **P-N junction**, where an electric field is established. This field acts like a one-way street, pushing electrons in one direction and holes in the other.

2.  **Sunlight Strikes the Panel**
    *   When sunlight (which is made of tiny packets of energy called **photons**) hits the solar cell, these photons are absorbed by the silicon atoms.

3.  **Electrons Get Excited and Released**
    *   If a photon has enough energy, it knocks an electron loose from its atom in the silicon material. This creates a free electron and a "hole" where the electron used to be.

4.  **The Electric Field Separates Charges**
    *   The electric field at the P-N junction plays a crucial role. It directs the newly freed electrons towards the N-type layer and the "holes" towards the P-type layer. This separation of charges is key to creating a flow of electricity.

5.  **Creating an Electric Current (DC)**
    *   Metal contacts (thin strips of conductive material) on the surface of the cell collect these separated electrons.
    *   When an external circuit (like a wire connecting to an appliance) is connected to the N-type and P-type layers, the accumulated electrons in the N-layer, driven by the potential difference, flow through the external circuit to the P-layer to recombine with the holes.
    *   This flow of electrons through the circuit is **direct current (DC) electricity**.

6.  **From Cells to Panels to Electricity for Your Home (AC)**
    *   **Cells to Panels:** A single solar cell produces only a small amount of electricity (around 0.5-0.6 volts). To get useful power, many cells are wired together in series (to increase voltage) and parallel (to increase current) to form a solar panel (or module).
    *   **DC to AC Conversion:** Most homes and the electrical grid use **alternating current (AC)**, not DC. Therefore, the DC electricity produced by the solar panels must be fed into an **inverter**. The inverter converts the DC electricity into AC electricity.
    *   **Usage and Grid Connection:** The AC electricity can then be used to power appliances in your home, or if you produce more than you need, it can be sent back to the electrical grid (often earning you credits through a process called net metering). Alternatively, it can be stored in batteries for later use.

In essence, solar panels harness the energy of photons to create a controlled flow of electrons, generating electricity without any moving parts or fuel consumption, directly from the sun's rays.
