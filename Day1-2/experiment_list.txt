🧪 Experiment 1: Temperature

Use a prompt:

“Write a short story about a robot who learns emotions.”

Run it with:

temperature = 0.1 → deterministic
temperature = 0.7 → creative
temperature = 1.2 → chaotic / unexpected

👉 Observe:
How creativity, randomness, and structure change.


🧪 Experiment 2: top_p (nucleus sampling)

Use the same prompt:

top_p = 0.1 → limited vocabulary
top_p = 0.5 → balanced
top_p = 0.9 → wide creative freedom

👉 Observe differences.

🧪 Experiment 3: top_k

Try:

top_k = 10
top_k = 50
top_k = 100

👉 See how restricting the candidate words affects output.


🧪 Experiment 4: frequency_penalty

Prompt:

“Explain AI in 3 sentences.”

Use:

frequency_penalty = 0 → repetitions allowed

frequency_penalty = 1 → repetitions reduced

👉 Notice how repeated words vanish.


🧪 Experiment 5: Write 3 prompts and compare outputs

Write:

A vague prompt
A detailed prompt
A strict structured prompt

Compare clarity, correctness, and consistency.
