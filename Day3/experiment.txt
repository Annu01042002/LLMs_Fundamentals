DAY 3 — Tokenization & Embeddings Practice Instructions

Today you will complete 3 simple and clear tasks. Keep everything short and practical.

----------------------------------------------------
1️⃣ TASK 1 — Generate Embeddings
----------------------------------------------------
• Take 3 sentences (two similar, one unrelated)
• Use Gemini embeddings model: `text-embedding-004`
• Convert each sentence into embeddings
• Print the vectors OR just the similarity scores

Goal: Understand how meaning becomes vectors.

----------------------------------------------------
2️⃣ TASK 2 — Compare Meaning with Cosine Similarity
----------------------------------------------------
• Compute similarity between:
    Sentence 1 ↔ Sentence 2  (similar meaning)
    Sentence 1 ↔ Sentence 3  (different meaning)

• Observe:
    High similarity  → similar meaning
    Low similarity   → different meaning

Goal: See how embeddings capture meaning, not words.

----------------------------------------------------
3️⃣ TASK 3 — Save Output to Folder
----------------------------------------------------
• Create a folder: `outputs_day3/`
• Save:
    - All sentences
    - Similarity scores
    - Your own notes (1–2 points)

Goal: Build the habit of documenting your LLM experiments.

----------------------------------------------------
✔ What You Should Learn Today
----------------------------------------------------
• What tokens are
• What embeddings are
• How sentences become vectors
• How cosine similarity works
• How to compare meaning using embeddings

Keep it simple. Don’t overthink.
Day 3 is about understanding how LLMs “see” meaning.
